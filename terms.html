          Welcome to the nQuanta Inc. (“nQuanta”) website located at <a href="/">www.zonkatron.com</a> (the “Site”). Please read these <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> (the “Terms”) and our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> (www.zonkatron.com/privacy) carefully because they govern your use of our Site. To make these Terms easier to read, the Site and our services are collectively called the “Services.” Through our services, individuals ("Candidates") and hiring managers ("Employers") can submit resume(s) (“Resume”) and receive worth ("Worth") for each resume. Employers can then select Candidates based on their Worth. Candidates and Employers are collectively known as "Users".

        <p class="lead">Agreement to Terms</p>
        <p>
          By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.

        <p class="underlined">
          Governing Law
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
        </p>
        <p class="underlined">
          Agreement to Arbitrate
        </p>
        <p>
          You and nQuanta agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that you and nQuanta are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and nQuanta otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
        </p>
        <p class="underlined">
          Arbitration Rules
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
        </p>
        <p class="underlined">
          Arbitration Process
        </p>
        <p>
          A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
        </p>
        <p class="underlined">
          Arbitration Location and Procedure
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless you and nQuanta otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and nQuanta submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
        </p>
        <p class="underlined">
          Arbitrator’s Decision
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. nQuanta will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
        </p>
        <p class="underlined">
          Fees
        </p>
        <p>
          Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, nQuanta will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
        </p>
        <p class="underlined">
          Changes
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if nQuanta changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="http://nquanta.co" target="_blank">nquanta.co</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of nQuanta’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and nQuanta in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
        </p>
        <p class="lead">General Terms</p>
        <p>
          These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between nQuanta and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between nQuanta and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without nQuanta’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. nQuanta may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any notices or other communications provided by nQuanta under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          nQuanta’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of nQuanta. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
